Pot-roast pork (Enchaud périgourdin)
I bought a couple of jars of Enchaud périgourdin in Périgueux market. It’s pork loin that is studded with garlic and pot-roasted with a small amount of stock and pig’s trotters, then left to go cold before being bottled. It’s designed to be thinly sliced and served with other cold meats, pâtés and pickles. I decided to create a version in which I stud the pork with plenty of garlic in the same way, wrap it in the skin to keep in the moisture and pot-roast it with lots of root vegetables for a deep winter flavour.

Butternut and sweet potato curry
This is a rambunctiously vibrant vegan curry, both to look at and eat. It is rich, sweet and hearty, with tomatoes providing a balancing acidity and the curry paste bringing uncompromising fire. Of course chillies do vary in heat, so if you’re after something a little less passage-clearing, use two rather than three, and if you want to go milder still, simply de-seed the chillies. Having said that, cooking with chillies always has a touch of roulette about it.

Potato and pea curry
Aloo dum is a potato and pea curry which is possibly the most common vegetable curry in India. It’s almost like chips with everything here, aloo dum with everything there. It’s either easy to make or hard, depending on what you want to do with it. If I was describing it to somebody I’d just say boil potatoes, fry them with garam masala, add some tomato, chilli, turmeric and salt and it’s done; then, if you like, throw in frozen peas just before the end.

Meatballs in a spicy tomato sauce (Boles de picolat)
This recipe came from a stall in Prades market where they were cooking boles meatballs in a huge paella pan.

Stuffed vegetables
When we were filming in Greece, stuffed vegetables was our favourite dish. It all stemmed from a brief lunch stop at the little fishing village of Astakos, where we asked what was for lunch at the first quayside café we came to.

Buckwheat pancakes with mushrooms and egg
This recipe comes from the town of Salers, famous for its cheese. Salers cheese is similar to Cantal but is made only from the milk of the cows grazing on its mountain pastures in the summer.

For lunch, we all ordered these hearty, yeasted pancakes.

It’s worth getting good-quality, well-marbled meat from the butcher’s shop for this dish. The supermarket meat is often too lean and will become dry rather than succulent during the long cooking.

They’re a perfect way of using up stale tortillas, which are cut into triangles, then fried or baked and known as totopos. Basic chilaquiles are then simmered with either salsa verde or salsa roja until they start to soften. This recipe is for the green-sauce version, with a fried egg, some crumbled cheese and a little soured cream and chopped coriander.

Golden egg curry
This magnificent addition to my eating life comes courtesy of Yasmin Othman (who has brought much deliciousness my way over the years) and I glow with gratitude every time I eat it. This – called masak lemak telur in Malaysian – is very far removed from the egg curries I remember from my early youth, and would much prefer to forget. What we have here are eggs poached in a rich, aromatic, turmeric-tinted, tamarind-sharp, coconutty sauce or soup.

Chilli chocolate truffles (Trufas de chocolate y chile pasilla)
These are addictive. Pasilla chillies are dried and have a gorgeous fruitiness about them, so this combination of chocolate, a hint of fruit and not too hot chilli makes for a great treat.

Alternatively, if you just refrigerate them and don’t add the batter, you have petits fours to go with coffee.

Salted chocolate tart
I have always avoided making chocolate tarts because I have never really felt that the pastry served the chocolate, or was worth the effort. This is my simple solution: make a base out of chocolate biscuits. And the filling is just as easy to make, too. I never lie about how effortless something is to make, but no one will believe me on this one.
For this recipe you will need a 23cm/9in deep-sided (approx. 5cm/2in deep), loosebottomed flan tin.
preptime:-
overnight
10 to 30 mins
Makes 1 large tart (14 small slices)
2 x 154g/5½oz packets chocolate cookies, such as Oreos or Bourbons(28 small biscuits in all)
50g/1¾oz dark chocolate (min. 70% cocoa solids)
50g/1¾oz unsalted butter, softened
½ tsp smoked sea salt flakes (see tip section)
100g/3½oz dark chocolate (minimum 70% cocoa solids)

Oven-cooked chicken shawarma
Chicken shawarma is usually cooked on a spit, but this is roasted in the oven. Here, I’ve served it modestly, on a pile of shredded iceberg, with some warmed pitta, lemon wedges and a tahini sauce. When I make this for groups of friends, or for a family lunch or supper, I slice up some fresh tomatoes sprinkled with mint, and cut some cucumbers into wedged slices, and macerate some red onions, cut into half-moons, with red wine vinegar or lime – in which case it will serve up to 10 people.

Salmon, avocado, watercress and pumpkin seed salad
This is a regular lunch or supper at casa mia, as anyone who follows me on Twitter or Instagram will recognise. I sometimes poach the salmon and keep it in the fridge (see tips), just so that I can make it even faster when the need hits. It’s quick work anyway, so this is more of an aside than a piece of advice.

Asparagus and poached egg puff tarts with parmesan and basil
A simple method for perfect poached egg is to have just a little water barely bubbling in a sauté pan then simply slide in the eggs and leave them to cook for a short while. The stiller water and the gentleness of adding them to the pan means that the eggs stay intact giving you an egg with a perfect poach.

Make these bars at the weekend, and you’ll be set up for the week if you’re someone who needs to grab-and-go in the morning.

Chai muffins
Taking tea in muffin form seems ideal for breakfast, and the warm spices of chai bring scented richness without heft. I’ve made these dairy-free, but if you want to, you can easily use semi-skimmed milk in place of the almond milk. I want to make it as easy as possible for you to make these, as this is a particularly splendid specimen of muffin.

I was first introduced to tarte flambée with the explanation that it’s France's answer to pizza. In fact, it’s not much like pizza at all, apart from being very thin and savoury. As it is made with unleavened dough, it bakes very crisply indeed, which is its great quality. I know you can get tarte flambée in London, but why it isn’t as famous as pizza escapes me.

Lamb cutlets with mint, chilli and golden potatoes
If you put your halved baby potatoes on to steam before you get started on the lamb chops, you can fairly effortlessly rely on a proper meat-and-potato supper in around 20 minutes (plus a little marinading time). Steaming the potatoes is, for me, an important stipulation: a steamed spud is a sweet spud; more than that, cooked this way, rather than by boiling, the potatoes are dry when done, which makes them easy to fry to crisp bronzedness.

Forgotten cookies
These little cookies – described by one friend as tasting like a cookie within a cookie – are really a mixture between a meringue and a cookie. Hence they’ve become known at home, where they’re immensely popular, as Merookies, and are ideal with a cup of coffee after dinner. They are called “forgotten” as, just like the 'Forgotten Pudding' in Nigella Express, they are not baked, but put in a hot oven, which you immediately turn off, leaving the cookies to bake in the fading residual heat overnight. I find it all too easy actually to forget them, and always put a post-it sticker on the oven to remind me they’re in there, so I don’t burn them to a cinder by preheating the oven to cook something else in it the next day.

Shami kebabs
Shami kebabs were apparently invented by a highly skilled chef for a toothless Nawab of Lucknow. The Nawab was so fat from overindulgence that he couldn’t get on a horse, and his teeth were all gone, presumably for the same reason. So a kebab was made so fine that it required no teeth to eat it. When I hear stories like that I’m inclined to think, ‘If you believe that, you’ll believe anything.’ But then again, it’s a nice story, and so are the kebabs – silky smooth and stuffed with just a little finely chopped onion, mint and green chilli.

Nigella's turkey breast with Christmas stuffing
A moist roast turkey with a spicy Christmas stuffing.You need to go to a butcher to get a whole breast joint and you need to ask for it to be butterflied and boned and make sure the skin is left on.

How to make meat and potato pie
This is one of my favourite pies: a great, no-nonsense recipe that does exactly what it says on the tin, and is all the better for it. I use chuck steak (also known as braising steak), which has lots of flavour, and two types of potato: a floury variety, which falls apart and thickens the gravy, and a waxier type that holds its shape to provide texture.

Potato and pepper bake
I never feel the need to apologize for using jars of chargrilled peppers, for while I don’t eat them just as they are, I find them the most useful ingredient. Just make sure that you are using peppers that are preserved in oil rather than brine. The potatoes don’t roast in this oil, so much as braise: they will crisp up in parts, but mostly just become softened and rich in the sweet peppery juices.
preptime:-

Harissa spiced lamb with cannellini beans
Mary Berry's rustic lamb casserole is full of flavour, especially if made ahead, and the lamb is meltingly tender. Harissa is a chilli paste with quite a kick; rose harissa, which I prefer to use, is sweeter and less fiery due to the addition of rose petals. I don’t like my food too spicy, so this dish is mild, but if you prefer it hot just add more harissa and good luck!

Gluten-free Venetian carrot cake
I long thought that carrot cake was an American invention, until I found out that an early version was made by Venetian Jews in the original ghetto. This modest disc is not much to look at - apart from a glorious golden-ness - but it is divine to eat. Only those with less austere eating habits will care to dollop alongside each damply crumbling wedge of cake my Italianate nod to the American cream-cheese frosting – a soft, rum-flavoured mascarpone cream.

Cider and five-spice bundt cake
Most of the time I refer to this as my Cider and five-spice gingerbread, but I changed the name out of concern for those who expect a little more gingeriness from their gingerbead. If you want to intensify the ginger element, use 250ml/9fl oz ginger beer in place of the cider.
This cake is wonderful enough plain as it is, though I have something of a faiblesse for the gleaming accompaniment of the smoky salted caramel sauce, as you can see from the picture.

Lemon pavlova
Ever since my first pav in 'How To Eat', I have been something of a pavaholic. For me, acidity is key. I never understood why anyone would pile sweet fruit on top of something that is essentially – and dreamily – a cross between a marshmallow and a meringue. I had the idea – yes, really – from the actor Michael Sheen. I saw him create a  great pile of lemony pavs on The Great Comic Relief Bake Off, and it inspired me. Diolch Michael (if I may).

Paneer jalfrezi
According to a poll featured in the British Curry Club’s in-house magazine, the jalfrezi is now the most popular choice in Britain’s Indian restaurants.

This paneer curry recipe is perfect for its main ingredient.

Chicken mole poblano
I have always had a problem with mole poblano, chilli and chocolate sauce, since I first tasted it in Mexico about 15 years ago and find it is often too sweet for my taste. Yet, I’m not unfamiliar with using chocolate in cooking, and a little in a rich red wine sauce works wonders. What I do like about mole poblano is the mixture of two dried chillies, mulato and pasilla, which gives the sauce a dark roasted fruitiness with just a hint of heat.
preptime:-
less than 30 mins

16 mulato or ancho chillies (about 200g/7oz), cleaned, seeds removed and retained

Scottish cranachan with a wee twist
Originally, the traditional Scottish cranachan celebrated the harvest, but now it is enjoyed year-round. There are many variations, but in all of them the trick is the slow toasting of the oatmeal; this is then mixed into the dish at the last minute so that its texture is retained. The quantities given here for the cardamom honey make a full jar, much more than you need for this amount of cranachan, but it will keep indefinitely; it is great over granola and in coffee.

Rye bread
Norwegians love their bread and loaves made with rye flour are particularly popular.This wonderful bread tastes a bit like sourdough – only better. We like it made with a mixture of white flour and rye so it isn’t too heavy, but you can change the proportions if you prefer a darker loaf – you may need to add extra water if using more rye. We cooked this by the side of a fjord after a trip on a longship, and we ate it with codfish (klippfisk) soup.

Roasted lamb shoulder with rosemary and paprika rub
Shoulder of lamb is quite fatty, but that’s what makes the meat so sweet and succulent, and by cooking it for a long time at a low temperature, the meat becomes so tender it just falls off the bone. This is the perfect roast to put in the oven and leave while you are out as it cooks slowly in the oven and you will return to a house full of wonderful aromas and meltingly tender meat. Serve it with fresh mint sauce.

Chicken and rosewater biryani
The rice in a biryani should be so dry and fluffy that when you throw a handful on the floor, all the grains should separate. The secret is to parboil the rice so that the surface is soft and cooked but the centre is still hard, and also to make sure that the main ingredient, i.e. the chicken, mutton, seafood or vegetables, is intensely flavoured but not surrounded by too much ‘gravy’, which will make the rice soggy when the final cooking in a sealed pot takes place.

Cookies and cream fudge brownies
When I was eight, chocolate brownies were my life. I scoured the local shops on my bike, looking for gainful employment to support my chocolate brownie habit. The ironmonger’s wife took pity on me and offered me a job paying £1 an hour to iron their smalls and sheets. After two hours I had enough cash to buy a couple of brownies, plus change for some sherbet lemons on the way home. It was worth every crease!

Rice bowl with ginger, radish and avocado
A rice bowl is a wondrous thing, but often – despite the simplicity of its title – a rather cluttered and complicated one. Here, I have pared it back, to make a gorgeously seasoned rice bowl, with nothing more than a few seeds, herbs and radishes stirred through it, and an avocado to top it. It’s a simple take on an inspiringly expansive idea. So please use this as a starting point only. It’s very much a non-recipe recipe, and every time I make it, I add something different, depending on what’s to hand.

Oven-roasted chicken with sumac and pomegranate molasses
This is an ideal chicken dish for an outdoor summer party. I favour cooking it in the oven because the marinade is apt to burn on a barbecue. Sumac is Turkey’s favourite spice. It’s a red berry with an astringent, lemony flavour, the fruit of a small bush. This dish is ideal as part of a warm and cold buffet where people have a bit of everything including a rice pilaf.

Tamarind-marinated bavette steak
Skirt or flank steak is eaten a lot in America, and in France, but hardly at all here in the UK. This is madness, as it is so much cheaper than any other sort of steak and so rich in flavour. I think what has put people off in the past is that, in Britain, it has been cooked in low and slow braises, which turns it into shoe leather. Bavette is the external part of the skirt (onglet being the internal connecting tissue) and all you need to do to cook it is, as my butcher puts it, “sear the hell out of it and serve it rare”. I find 2 minutes a side on a very hot, ridged griddle optimum, but this does mean it’s only for those who like their steak blue.

Triple chocolate buckwheat cookies
The star here is the buckwheat, not only because it makes these cookies gluten-free, but mainly because I feel it brings its own nutty flavour and unique texture, creating a cookie that has softness and a shortbready bite, as well as a subtle smokiness. Those who like a truly chewy cookie might find these a little cakey, but I like chewiness in a cookie and yet find constant excuses to make these.

Scotch pies
Also known as mutton pies, these have a very long history. In the middle ages, they were frowned upon by the Scottish church, viewed as luxurious, decadent English-style food. In later centuries, they proved to be convenient and sustaining snacks for working people, who would buy them hot from pie-men or pie-wives in the city streets. The space on top of the pie, created by the raised crust, would sometimes be filled with gravy, beans or mashed potato.

Chocolate olive oil mousse
I first came across a version of this voluptuously soft, rich chocolate mousse at one of my favourite places to eat in London. Then – as these things tend to happen – I started finding it everywhere. The olive oil doesn’t just bring its resonant flavour to the mousse, it creates its smooth, soft texture. Go for a smooth but still spicy rather than raspingly peppery extra-virgin olive oil, and use the absolute best quality you can.
