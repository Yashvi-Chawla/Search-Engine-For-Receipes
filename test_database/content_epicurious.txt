Oaxaca Old Fashioned 
Widely known as the quintessential calling card of mezcal cocktails, the Oaxaca Old Fashioned was developed by bartender Phil Ward during his time at Death & Co., but the uncomplicated yet memorable union of tequila, mezcal, agave nectar, and bitters rose to fame on the menu at Mayahuel.
